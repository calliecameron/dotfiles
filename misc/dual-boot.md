# Access to Windows partitions on dual boot

1. Use `sudo blkid` to find the UUID of the Windows partition.
2. Add a line like the following to /etc/fstab:
    `UUID=<UUID>    /mnt/windows    ntfs-3g    defaults,inherit,permissions    0    0`
3. Create as root the mount point, e.g. /mnt/windows. The mount point should NOT
   be under /media, or it will be considered a removable drive.
4. Make sure the mount works, with `sudo mount -a`.
5. Unmount the partition with `sudo umount /mnt/windows`.
6. Create user mapping: run `sudo ntfs-3g.usermap /dev/<dev>`, where `<dev>` is
   the partition in question. This creates a UserMapping file.
7. Mount the partition again, and put the UserMapping file in a folder
   '.NTFS-3G' in the root of the NTFS partition.
8. Unmount and remount the partition so that the user mapping takes effect.
9. See [](../packages/04-common-dirs/README.md) for environment variables you
   can set to make accessing the Windows partition more convenient.
