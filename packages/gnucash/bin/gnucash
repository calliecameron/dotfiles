# Always run Gnucash in a fixed timezone; this is a workaround for
# https://bugs.gnucash.org/show_bug.cgi?id=137017. Gnucash saves transaction
# dates as timestamps at midnight on that date in the local timezone, and it
# converts saved dates into human-readable dates for display using the local
# timezone. If the timezone has changed between saving and displaying, this can
# lead to the displayed dates being off-by-one from the date that was originally
# entered.
#
# Using 'CEST-2' (UTC+2) here since all the existing transactions are in UTC,
# UTC+1, or UTC+2; with UTC+2 they will all be displayed using the correct date
# (and future transactions will always be UTC+2).
