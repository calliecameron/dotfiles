# Always run Gnucash in a fixed timezone; this is a workaround for
# https://bugs.gnucash.org/show_bug.cgi?id=137017. Gnucash saves
# transaction dates as timestamps at midnight on that date in the
# local timezone, and it converts saved dates into human-readable
# dates for display using the local timezone. If the timezone has
# changed between saving and displaying, this can lead to the
# displayed dates being off-by-one from the date that was originally
# entered.
#
# Using 'CEST-2' (UTC+2) here since all the existing transactions are
# in UTC, UTC+1, or UTC+2; with UTC+2 they will all be displayed using
# the correct date (and future transactions will always be UTC+2).
